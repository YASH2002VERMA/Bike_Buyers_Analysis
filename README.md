##Process of the Project
Step 1: Data Collection
Imported a dataset of 1,026 records containing demographic, financial, and lifestyle details of potential bike buyers.
Step 2: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Removed 26 records to work with a refined dataset of 1,000 entries.
Created an "Age Brackets" column to classify customers into age groups.
Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Used pivot tables to analyze income levels of buyers vs. non-buyers.
Categorized key factors like Gender, Income, Occupation, and Commute Distance.
Step 4: Data Visualization (Dashboard)

Created a dashboard to summarize buyer demographics and purchasing trends (although the sheet is currently empty, it likely had visual elements in Excel).

Key Insights from the Project
Income vs. Bike Purchase:

Buyers had lower average incomes than non-buyers.
Males had higher average incomes than females across both groups.
Age Factor:

Younger and middle-aged groups were more likely to buy bikes than older individuals.
Occupation & Purchase Trend:

Professionals and clerical workers showed a higher tendency to buy bikes.
Commute Distance:

People with shorter commutes (0-1 miles, 2-5 miles) had higher bike purchase rates.


Conclusion
Target Audience for Bike Sales:

Focus on middle-income individuals (around $58,000 - $82,500 range).
Younger and middle-aged people are more likely to buy.
Marketing Strategies:

Promote bikes in urban areas with shorter commute distances.
Create discounts or installment plans for lower-income buyers.
